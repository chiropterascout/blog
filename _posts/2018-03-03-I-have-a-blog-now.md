I'm actually at a loss for what to do here, if I'm honest.

like what do I write here that I don't already write on my twitter? or my AD twitter? anything I might write as a blog post I already write as tweetstorms... and hoo boy do I tweetstorm.

I guess it's probably mostly going to be art.

so like I said in that first post that I might do commentary for my poetry. I guess I'll do that. and I've been talking to my therapist about trauma, and thinking about it a lot. so... let's start with that.

[circa 2009](https://imogenerative.github.io/poetry/circa%202009/) is the story of my trauma. stop reading.

yeah okay.

###### _[an open letter to my rapist in the third person](https://imogenerative.github.io/poetry/circa%202009/an%20open%20letter%20to%20my%20rapist%20in%20the%20third%20person)_

I started with that old love poem - _[touch me taste me breathe me](https://imogenerative.github.io/poetry/the%20telegraph%20pole%20has%20spoke%20to%20me/touch%20me%20taste%20me%20breathe%20me)_ - which was incidentally the first poem I read at Silver Words. anyway, I start with that then move into where it gets dark. I scattered lines from old poems throughout both of the open letters. I guess I felt the meditative and abstract stuff from years ago was informed by this.

```
lose herself and she didn't think she wanted to be found
something strange in there something wrong

that was always there and still is
```

it never really left me, but the next line is just...

```

burning them away with her memories.
```

see I only started using "them" relatively recently. it was in a sense an escape from my past, but also not. cause you can never really escape something like this. but yeah, "her" memeories haunt me, in a sense that I feel - still - that it happened to someone else. dissociation does that.

he was... so... careful... not to leave any marks. so now... I want the marks whenever I do anything with anyone. proof for myself. so when I wake up I know... that definitely happened. I have the bruises to prove it to myself.

and then there's the scars. I did those. as recently as last week, actually. I'm not proud of that.

###### _[a followup letter to my rapist in the first person](https://imogenerative.github.io/poetry/circa%202009/a%20followup%20letter%20to%20my%20rapist%20in%20the%20first%20person)_

I really kept going with the butchering old poetry to write these here. like I even reference it in this one.

as an aside: fuck you.

this one really ran with the using old poetry. it's almost a rewrite of _touch me taste me breathe me_.

```
    it was only you. I wasn't there.
    there but not there. here but not here.

    is but not is.

    how much is this. how much is what is else.
```

I wasn't there. I couldn't be. I mean, there was ketamine. that made it very easy to not be there. I didn't want to be there and I had an out - dissociation - which I took. gladly. it still fucked me up though. like... well:

```
I am trapped in a memory 
I can't get out I can't get out I can't get out I can't get out 
```

even with the dissociation, it's still there. it was.. unformed... but there. it's more crystalline now. it is a memory that I'll never be rid of.

```
I see it happening

the terrifying truth
```

yeah.

```
I thought I knew

no

I thought I
```

well I did start these by lifting lines from other works. this isn't though:

```
          I think I knew this
          all the time.
```

and I did, I didn't want to admit it - even to myself - but... I did.

###### _[reminiscent of a broken girl](https://imogenerative.github.io/poetry/circa%202009/reminiscent%20of%20a%20broken%20girl)_

I don't really have much to say about this. this is about the actual thing that happened and it's lasting effect. neither are good.

###### _[leave them in ther grave](https://imogenerative.github.io/poetry/circa%202009/leave%20them%20in%20their%20grave)_

I'm back onto my current pronoun here, in a fairly dark way:

```
leave them in their grave

in the garden
behind the orchard

leave them for the daisies and the daisies for the bees.
```

I've wanted to die so much in the aftermath of this. living with the pain of it is... almost unbearable. but I do. I go on. I've only tried to kill myself 8 times since that day in 2009. I'm apparently... really bad at it.

```
they almost did again. and again. and again.

they aren't exactly counting since becoming someone else.
```

that is of course not counting the times I've gotten so. fucked. up. just to cope and not been sure if I was going to wake up. there have been a lot more of those. though I got used to my poisons - _touch me taste me breathe me_ is kind of about dissociatives **and** love. and how fucked up is that. the worst thing that has ever happened to me happened on dissociatives, and to this day I take them "recreationally". I guess thoy gave me a place of safety in the escape, and I long for that disconnect from the world and everything that's wrong with mine.

```
leave them in their grave,
that they dug for someone else.
```

so let the past die. kill it, if you have to. that's the only way to become what you were meant to be.

I will be informed by my past. not defined by it.
