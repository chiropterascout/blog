  hi, my name is Scout Quinn, and I’m a software developer 💻 with a fine arts degree 🎨. I currently work for [@thoughtworks](https://github.com/thoughtworks) 💭 as a consultant developer ([scout.quinn@thoughtworks.com](mailto:scout.quinn@thoughtworks.com) 📧) and I'm a sport fencer 🤺. ~~I'm also genderqueer and/or non-binary and/or agender... I really don't know precisely where I fit outide the gender binary other than "outside it"~~ *I'm agender, **they/them*** 🌈. I founded a sibling group to PyLadies called PyEnbies in late 2017. We met monthly... ish... in Melbourne, Australia and we have a Slack, because of course we do. swing me an email at [pyenbies@dfdt.me](mailto:pyenbies@dfdt.me) 📧 if you want to know more about that.
  
  I've previously worked at [@codeforaustralia](https://github.com/codeforaustralia) 🇦🇺 and [@ACMIlabs](https://github.com/ACMIlabs) 🎥. at ACMI I worked on the museum operating system concept building microservices, and at code for australia I worked on a team with the victorian equal opportunity and human rights commission building proofs of concept for potential digital solutions to tackle barriers to reperting racism in victoria. prior to working in software development I was a science communicator 🔬 and worked as a STEM ambassador fot the university of tasmania 🎓. 
 
  in terms of my [art](https://scoutquinn.github.io) 🎨 practice (haven't used that word for a while) I write a lot of concrete [poetry](https://scoutquinn.github.io/poetry) 🖊 (and do slams) 🎤 and I'm interested in the intersection of code and art, but not in the "beautiful code" way people usually mean when they talk about that, I'm more into the idea that there are things we can do with code as a tool for creating art, because technology is a paintbrush. 🖌 I heard that at a sales meeting.

  You can check out my code at [@scoutquinn](https://github.com/scoutquinn) 💻 and my twines at [calculush.gq](https://calculush.gq) 🎮 and the weird music I make on graphics calculators is on soundcloud as [razor_lined](https://soundcloud.com/razor_lined) 🎧. that's right I said graphics calculators. my noise friend [Uboa](https://uboa.bandcamp.com/) described it as "chipnoise".

  I advise against following my [twitter](https://twitter.com/calculush) 🐦 or reading my [blog](blog) 📖, but you should check out my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D6KiDY4bMC-Ijw29iwuN32lGAnVwJIbq7kkkQwZmayM/edit?usp=sharing) 📑 or hit me up on [keybase](https://keybase.io/scoutquinn) 🔑.
